# Assets Required

The following assets are referenced in `app.json` but need to be created:

- `assets/icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 recommended)
- `assets/splash.png` - Splash screen image
- `assets/adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon
- `assets/favicon.png` - Web favicon

For the assessment, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares. The app will work without these assets, but you may see warnings.

To create placeholder assets quickly, you can:
1. Use any image editing tool to create simple colored squares
2. Use online tools like https://www.appicon.co/
3. Or simply use any existing images temporarily
